# Description

This browser application allows users to search for a city and see today's weather and a five-day forecast.

On the left side of the screen, user's can enter the name of a city and search for it to see the weather. The weather data that will appear are temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index.

Once the user searches for a city, it will appear in a search history list below the search button. Users can then click previous searches to search for the weather for that city.

The UV index that appears is dynamically color coded to show the severity. UV indexes color coded red signify "severe", yellow is "moderate", and green is "favorable".

# Setup/Installation Requirements

Clone this repository to VS code. Open /Users/mrao/Code/weatherdash/index.html in your browser.

Alternatively, the webpage can be accessed at https://jmrao002.github.io/weatherdash/

# Known Bugs

Not a bug, but an improvement that could be made would be to keep functions from running if the API response is empty. At this time, entering text that does not match a city will return no data.
